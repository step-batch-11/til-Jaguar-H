# Today I Learned

how random works how to bais random how perlin noise works

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- how random works and probability of getting a number is same as of other -i
  learned about gausion curve

---

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- perlin noise is something i am not so sure about

---

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- how does perlin noise works

---

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- perlin noise pattern
- writing my own perlin noise formula

- gausion distribution using random

```
const gaussionRandom = (average, deivation) => {
  const randomNumber = Math.random();
  if (Math.round(Math.random()) === 1) {
    return (randomNumber * deivation) + average;
  }
  return average - (randomNumber * deivation);
};
```

this function allows me to get a random number but in given standard deviation
